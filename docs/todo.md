* do my particles EVER slow down? kinetic energy seems to be going infinite
    * neutralizing background? I'm zeroing the rho_F[0] component, but is that enough?
* particle pusher tests
* see if half frequency calculation of energy is correct with current setup
* add epsilon_0 to test cases in fourier solver


optimalizations:
* try numpy.fft instead of scipy.fftpack
* use pycuda for particles
